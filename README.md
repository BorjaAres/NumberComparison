# Number Comparison Program

This is a simple JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter two numbers, compares them, and displays the result on a web page.

## Description

The program asks the user to enter two numbers using JavaScript's prompt function. The numbers are parsed as floating-point values using the parseFloat function to ensure decimal values are supported. The program then compares the two numbers and displays a message indicating which number is greater or if they are equal.
Usage

## To use this program, follow these steps:

 Open the HTML file in a web browser.
 A prompt will appear asking you to enter a number. Enter a valid floating-point number and click "OK".
 Another prompt will appear asking you to enter another number. Enter a valid floating-point number and click "OK".
 The program will compare the two numbers and display a message on the web page indicating which number is greater or if they are equal.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program works:

Give me a number: 2.5
And another one!: 1.8

Output: 2.5 is greater than 1.8
